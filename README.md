## Classification Work

- [x] Use PCA to check the classification performance
- [x] Add time window sampling with bins
- [x] Gaussian Kernel Thresholding Sqrt Delay (Read paper), this is not we are going to do.

### Classification Method Trade-off
Bayesian classification performs worse compared to KNN.

### PCA Analysis
According to the performance comparison between classification model with/without PCA embedded, it is found that PCA 
would not play a significant role in this project.  

### Time Window Bins Analysis
In this project, a time window is used to generate the firing rate and its corresponding hand position information. 
For instance, a time window $[t_1, t_2]$ is dynamically selected, where $t_1$ and $t_2$ represent staring and end 
time step, respectively. Furthermore, the sampling frequency between the specified time window is 20.

The classification performance was compared with firing rate generated by two sorts of approaches (i.e., one is 
obtained by using all data long a single trial, another one is sampled by time window). It is found that the 
classification accuracy is reduced from 97% to 93%, which would highly worse the following linear regression 
performance (**Note: We need add RMSE comparison table**).

### Gaussian Kernel Thresholding 

It is found that it can be a normalization, while not other kinds of unknown techniques.
